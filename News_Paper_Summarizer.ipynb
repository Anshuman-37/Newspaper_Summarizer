While we already knew that Manchester City and Liverpool were both quite good at football, Sundayâs ding-dong at least served to reinforce that view, even if Liverpool were uncharacteristically poor in the first half before getting what one assumes was a gegen-rocket up the collective backside from JÃ¼rgen Klopp at the break.\n",

            "What we learned from one of the post-match interviews is that (1) Kevin De Bruyne knows Virgil van Dijk, (2) that the Manchester City midfielder sees Virgil a lot, (3) that his and Virgilâs children attend the same school and (4) like to play together which (5) provided the background for their âfriendly chatâ on the final whistle. These revelations that elite, gifted footballers arenât actually kept cryogenically frozen in chambers only to be thawed out for training and matches appear to have come as a shock to many viewers, who had no idea that the existence of top athletes can be as mundane, if not more crushingly dull than those lived by the rest of us.

Despite his anger, Pep was all smiles after the game as he and his opposite number JÃ¼rgen Klopp wrapped each other in a warm and tight embrace.\n",

            "\t NEWS :  Right, we need to talk about Final Fantasy IX Remake again, because the rumours have well and truly returned. This supposed remake first popped up in the now infamous Nvidia leak, which outed loads of potential video game projects. Just after the leak happened in September of last year, Nvidia came out and confirmed that the information was legit â but cautioned that the listings were used for \"internal tracking and testing\" only. Basically, the company was trying to throw some water on the fire.\n",
            "\n",
            "The thing is, many of these projects have since been officially announced. Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition happened. Street Fighter 6 happened. Crysis 4 happened. Sniper Elite 5 happened. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy happened. A bunch of others happened.\n",
            "\n",
            "But perhaps most importantly, one of the leak's most outlandish listings turned out to be real very, very recently. We are of course referring to Kingdom Hearts 4, which was officially revealed over the weekend. Together with the aforementioned Chrono Cross remaster, the heavily rumoured Final Fantasy Tactics remake, and the suspiciously trademarked Tactics Ogre: Reborn, it's looking like the Nvidia leak could be bang on â especially when it comes to Square Enix.\n",
            "\n",
            "Which leads us back to Final Fantasy IX Remake. With every leaked project that becomes a reality, the return of this beloved PlayStation RPG seems increasingly possible. Now, it could just be that the Final Fantasy IX Remake listing did refer to some kind of test, and isn't something that Square Enix is actually working on â but that won't stop the internet from chewing on this rumour for a while yet.\n",
            "\n",
            "What do you think? Could Final Fantasy IX Remake be real? Do you want Square Enix to revisit Zidane's grand adventure? Maybe have your say in our remakes poll, and then kidnap a princess in the comments section below.\n",

            "\n",
            "Activity in the sector fell 0.4% on the month, driven by a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment and a 4.3% fall in computer, electronic and optical products, where disruption to the availability of microchips has hit production volumes around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tourism rose strongly after the easing of pandemic restrictions led to an increase in people booking holidays in the UK and overseas, with growth of 33.1% for travel agencies and tour operators. The accommodation sector, which includes hotels, recorded a 23% rise in activity as more people travelled within the UK, contributing to the first month of positive growth for hotels and camping grounds since August.\n",

            "âThe news that the economy was hardly growing at all in February suggests the economy had a little less momentum in the first quarter than we had previously thought,â said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. â[It] increases the risk of a contraction in GDP in the coming months as the squeeze on household real incomes intensifies.â\n",

            "\n",
            "Some businesses said disruption from the storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin during the month had hindered trade, including in the building industry, restaurants and takeaways, hairdressing and beauty, and leisure parks and holiday centres.

            "âFebruaryâs slowdown is likely to be the start of a prolonged period of considerably weaker growth as rising inflation, surging energy bills and higher taxes increasingly damages key drivers of UK output, including consumer spending and business investment,â he said.\n",
