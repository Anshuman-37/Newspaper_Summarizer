            "On the day before this “humiliation” at Anfield, to use Ralph Rangnick’s own word, the German claimed it could take just two or three windows to get back to the top. By the end of it, he was talking about “six years”.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was certainly a defeat of historic proportions. The biggest aggregate difference between United and Liverpool in the two games over a single season had been a mere five goals. That was almost doubled, to nine. Liverpool beat them by a combined score by 9-0 and that was despite the fact it felt like Jurgen Klopp's team “declared” in both games.\n",
            "\n",
            "For Rangnick’s part, the trebling of the timescale was for slightly different outcomes. The first prediction was to just challenge. The second was to get to Liverpool’s kind of level, where they are a club so supremely run – with “25 Formula One racing cars” – that they are going for an unprecedented quadruple.\n",
            "\n",
            "How long it actually takes, to get to either point, entirely depends on what United do next. This moment of crisis should be one of opportunity, because the extent of the problems should allow free rein, an opportunity to finally be frank about what is required. United no longer have to be anchored to Ed Woodward’s misguided ideas about how close they are.\n",
            "\n",
            "Klopp, from the comfortable vantage point of embarrassing superiority, was able to be magnanimous. He refused to really criticise United’s display, say the game was easy, or even elaborate on their problems. Klopp’s restraint still revealed enough, though.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We did what we had to do. United is obviously a difficult situation, look at the line-up, without their central midfielders. Then when you are in a difficult situation, you get another knock.”\n",

At the same time, a night like this – on top of so many like it – does not happen as a consequence of decisions made immediately before the game.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s also why some of the talk about United collapsing – in the way bad Liverpool or United teams of the past never did – or not having any fight is some way misplaced. This is a sport that has been constantly transformed in the last decade. It is much more systemised. That means that any elite team that has a finely tuned system can more easily beat one that is dysfunctional. It is more difficult for any individuals, no matter how inspirational or aggressive, to have the same rallying effect. The game is more scientific. If a team has a gap, it will be more difficult to bridge, and easier to exploit. You can't really dig in in the same way.\n",
            "\n",

            "It was one of the nights where the nature of the post-match discussion will naturally provoke questions over whether it was more down to Liverpool’s brilliance or United’s problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "As inevitable as it might seem that the media focus on the negatives here, it’s impossible not to. Liverpool didn’t need to be that good. They didn’t need to push themselves. They looked so good, with people talking about a modern version of the 5-0 over Nottingham Forest in 1987-88, precisely because United afforded them the ample space to express themselves. It could not have been easier.\n",

A purported render of the device shared by Evan Blass over at 91Mobiles lines up with past leaks and rumors, showing a device with a familiar circular design, physical crown, and Fitbit integration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, there’s also a lot missing from the render. The image doesn’t include the watch’s lugs (which would show how the strap will connect to the face) or give any idea of its overall build. If the image looks a bit funny, though, it’s perhaps because of the watch’s rumored bezel-less design (also seen in mock-up renders shared last year by Jon Prosser).\n",
            "\n",
            "Interestingly, though, we have seen a smartwatch design that looks like this from Google before: the LG Watch Style, which LG designed in conjunction with the tech giant and released in 2017 to show off Android Wear 2.0. It has the same simplicity of lines and crown placement — though, of course, we’d hope for a much slimmer look five years on.\n",

The company has been investing in the smartwatch space for years, buying Fitbit and parts of Fossil in 2019 and trickling out Android Wear updates, but it’s been slow-moving and decisively outmaneuvered by Apple.\n",

Is this going to work equally well with all Android phones or will it prioritize Google’s own Pixel ecosystem? What about iOS?” Stay tuned to The Verge to find out more.\n",

Hannah Wilcock, 25, and her parents were astounded to learn the 'lumps of coal' they heard hit their drive on the night of February 28 were fragments of a 4.6-billion-year-old meteorite. Weighing around 300g in total the meteorite pierced through the sky and crashed onto their driveway in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire. The meteorite is some of the most valuable space rock ever to fall on the UK and has had metal detectorists scouring fields in Gloucestershire. Hannah said she had been inside her parent's home when she heard a thud, she told the BBC: 'When I heard it drop, I stood up and looked out the window to see what was there. 'But because it was dark, I couldn't see anything. It was only the next morning when we went out that we saw it on the drive - a bit like a kind of splatter.

Then when you are in a difficult situation, you get another knock.” This is why any discussion of Tuesday’s match inevitably evolved into discussion of the last decade. If a team has a gap, it will be more difficult to bridge, and easier to exploit. In other words, they incorporated the intelligence to articulate a clear idea, and took every major decision from there. Then again, the reluctance to take such decisions has been one of the reasons United are where they are.\n",
