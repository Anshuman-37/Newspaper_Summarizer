Austin, however, is cool, weird and succeeded in entrenching F1 in the States.) It’s cosmopolitan, seedy and a playground for a fair few celebrities – Hamilton, not least. In an effort to bring more of that Tubbs and Crockett flavor to the race – fittingly sponsored by a cryptocurrency firm, as Miami angles to become the Wall Street of blockchain – organizers added a pool area, two stories of cabanas and a fake yacht marina that looks like something out of Minecraft. Miami Gardens, the largest Florida city with a majority Black population, has been dreading the arrival of this motorsport Super Bowl ever since their attempts to ship the race elsewhere were thwarted three years ago. Last May a recall election was sought to remove council members who voted to bring the race to Miami Gardens. ( What’s more, Miami Gardens residents are locked into this deal for a decade, with F1 president Stefano Domenicali promising to leave “a positive and lasting contribution for the people in the local community”.'

	GPT - 'It has Charles Leclerc playing catch with the Marlins’ Jazz Chisholm Jr, Lewis Hamilton teeing off with Tom Brady and Daniel Ricciardo and Lando Norris chasing James Corden around the paddock in cutoff team shirts. But this time, rather than return to Motown or Moo Town, F1 has parked its massive traveling circus here, to the land of white sand beaches, neon lights and withering heat. The closest the series ever got to Miami was Sebring, Florida, a fabled inland racing venue three hours north that served as the backdrop for the one-off 1959 US Grand Prix. Last May a recall election was sought to remove council members who voted to bring the race to Miami Gardens. ( Worse than those lawmakers getting into bed with F1, residents felt as if they had agreed to a bad deal – one that promised only $5m in community benefits and 5% of revenues to the city. What’s more, Miami Gardens residents are locked into this deal for a decade, with F1 president Stefano Domenicali promising to leave “a positive and lasting contribution for the people in the local community”. It’s an undercurrent of controversy that puts Miami squarely in league with Sochi, Saudi Arabia and other dubious F1 crash pads.'

	BERT - 'Apple, Google and Microsoft have announced a joint effort to support a new type of online sign-in which could replace passwords with more secure alternatives. Among the fields affected, technology, finance, construction, healthcare, and hospitality were shown to experience the most security incidents. The list revealed that '123456', was the most popular password among CEOs, having been used by 29,401 executives across the 290 million data breaches. ' Grahame Williams, identity and access management director at defence firm Thales, said passwords were 'becoming increasingly insecure' and 'easily hacked'.

Moore said passwords play a big part in account security as they can be easily changed when compromised and don't directly rely on unique device identifiers such as a smartphone or watch. 'Passwords will continue to be part of our lives as we make this transition, so we'll remain dedicated to making conventional sign-ins safer and easier through our existing products and continued innovation.' 'Just as we design our products to be intuitive and capable, we also design them to be private and secure,' said Kurt Knight, Apple's Senior Director of Platform Product Marketing.'

The tech giants said the new system would also allow people to use a fingerprint or facial scan authentication on their smartphone as a way of signing in on another device nearby, regardless of which operating system or browser they were running. This would reduce the need for people to remember a wide range of username and password combinations to log in to different services, they said. Apple, Google and Microsoft said they hoped to start making these capabilities available across their platforms over the coming year. The technology giants agreed to support a common passwordless sign-in which has been created by industry body the Fido Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium. New research by NordPass has revealed the most popular passwords used by CEOs – with '123456' and 'password' continuing to top the list. Password' was next, with 22,511 uses, followed by '12345' (11,876 uses), '123456789' (10,988 uses) and 'qwerty' (9,738 uses).

But sanctions imposed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have changed that calculus. The space station will still be travelling so fast that it will begin to heat and cast off debris in a path behind it. Point Nemo has been called a spacecraft cemetery because - as the point on the Earth most distant from any land - it is where decommissioned spacecraft are typically aimed when returning to the Earth.'

Until now, scientists have known very little about these blobs, why they exist, and why they have odd shapes of varying heights.

Edward Garnero, a seismologist at ASU Tempe who was not involved in the work, noted that this is the first time any researcher has made a serious case for this theory "I think it's completely viable until someone tells me it's not."
