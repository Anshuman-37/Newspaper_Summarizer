            "The Fiver is all about self-improvement and finds itself incapable of watching a football match without learning the now traditional “five things”. While we already knew that Manchester City and Liverpool were both quite good at football, Sunday’s ding-dong at least served to reinforce that view, even if Liverpool were uncharacteristically poor in the first half before getting what one assumes was a gegen-rocket up the collective backside from Jürgen Klopp at the break.\n",
            "\n",
            "What we learned from one of the post-match interviews is that (1) Kevin De Bruyne knows Virgil van Dijk, (2) that the Manchester City midfielder sees Virgil a lot, (3) that his and Virgil’s children attend the same school and (4) like to play together which (5) provided the background for their “friendly chat” on the final whistle. These revelations that elite, gifted footballers aren’t actually kept cryogenically frozen in chambers only to be thawed out for training and matches appear to have come as a shock to many viewers, who had no idea that the existence of top athletes can be as mundane, if not more crushingly dull than those lived by the rest of us. Or that both men live in Cheshire, hence the pow-wows on the school run.\n",

            "It also went some way towards explaining why Pep Guardiola went full Basil Fawlty – without a trace of irony or awareness – when Van Dijk clipped De Bruyne to bring him down with a technical foul that could not have been more ‘Fernandinho’ if it had a shaved head, was sporting a big 25 on its back and was dancing the samba through Londrina’s main drag. Despite his anger, Pep was all smiles after the game as he and his opposite number Jürgen Klopp wrapped each other in a warm and tight embrace.\n",

            "With ne’er a flying pizza slice, an angry finger-wagging Irishman or a 22-man stramash involving a variety of fists and boots emerging from a cartoon cloud it has become abundantly clear that the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester City is sadly lacking in the kind of sneering mutual contempt, childish needle and belligerent rancour that powers all the most entertaining feuds. Following a weekend in which Neil Warnock announced his retirement from management, perhaps one or both clubs could bring him in as an anger-management consultant to help generate some much-needed animosity.\n",

            "\t NEWS :  Right, we need to talk about Final Fantasy IX Remake again, because the rumours have well and truly returned. This supposed remake first popped up in the now infamous Nvidia leak, which outed loads of potential video game projects. Just after the leak happened in September of last year, Nvidia came out and confirmed that the information was legit — but cautioned that the listings were used for \"internal tracking and testing\" only. Basically, the company was trying to throw some water on the fire.\n",
            "\n",
            "The thing is, many of these projects have since been officially announced. Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition happened. Street Fighter 6 happened. Crysis 4 happened. Sniper Elite 5 happened. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy happened. A bunch of others happened.\n",
            "\n",
            "But perhaps most importantly, one of the leak's most outlandish listings turned out to be real very, very recently. We are of course referring to Kingdom Hearts 4, which was officially revealed over the weekend. Together with the aforementioned Chrono Cross remaster, the heavily rumoured Final Fantasy Tactics remake, and the suspiciously trademarked Tactics Ogre: Reborn, it's looking like the Nvidia leak could be bang on — especially when it comes to Square Enix.\n",
            "\n",
            "Which leads us back to Final Fantasy IX Remake. With every leaked project that becomes a reality, the return of this beloved PlayStation RPG seems increasingly possible. Now, it could just be that the Final Fantasy IX Remake listing did refer to some kind of test, and isn't something that Square Enix is actually working on — but that won't stop the internet from chewing on this rumour for a while yet.\n",
            "\n",
            "What do you think? Could Final Fantasy IX Remake be real? Do you want Square Enix to revisit Zidane's grand adventure? Maybe have your say in our remakes poll, and then kidnap a princess in the comments section below.\n",

            "The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product rose by only 0.1% in February, down from a monthly growth rate of 0.8% in January when the economy was recovering from the coronavirus Omicron variant.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Activity in the sector fell 0.4% on the month, driven by a 5.4% drop in the manufacture of transport equipment and a 4.3% fall in computer, electronic and optical products, where disruption to the availability of microchips has hit production volumes around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tourism rose strongly after the easing of pandemic restrictions led to an increase in people booking holidays in the UK and overseas, with growth of 33.1% for travel agencies and tour operators. The accommodation sector, which includes hotels, recorded a 23% rise in activity as more people travelled within the UK, contributing to the first month of positive growth for hotels and camping grounds since August.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "The latest snapshot comes as business leaders and economists warn that Britain will probably struggle for growth in the coming months as soaring energy bills and the rising cost of the weekly shop drags down consumer spending power.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The news that the economy was hardly growing at all in February suggests the economy had a little less momentum in the first quarter than we had previously thought,” said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. “[It] increases the risk of a contraction in GDP in the coming months as the squeeze on household real incomes intensifies.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Thomas Pugh, an economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK, said February may be the last month of growth for a while. “Surging fuel prices, slumping business and consumer confidence and supply chain disruptions will start to be felt from March and will really kick into gear in April when consumer energy prices rose by 54%,” he said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some businesses said disruption from the storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin during the month had hindered trade, including in the building industry, restaurants and takeaways, hairdressing and beauty, and leisure parks and holiday centres. Some companies reported a positive impact, such as those in fencing, torch sales and temporary off-grid power.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reflecting the hit to the building industry as sites were forced to close and cranes became idle amid the disruption, output in the construction sector fell by 0.1% on the month.\n",

            "Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the government needed to provide more financial support to companies and businesses to deal with rising cost pressures.\n",
            "\n",
            "“February’s slowdown is likely to be the start of a prolonged period of considerably weaker growth as rising inflation, surging energy bills and higher taxes increasingly damages key drivers of UK output, including consumer spending and business investment,” he said.\n",
